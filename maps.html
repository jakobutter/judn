      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspive been an avid source engine & valve fanatic
        since i was eleven years old. when i was twelve i dug my grubby fingers into
        mapmaking, which i was very shit at. i cant even use the excuse of "i was 12" cause,
        ive seen good maps made by young people.</p>
      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspi never put as much time into source as i did other hobbies
        like music. still it is something i have a deep-rooted passion for. any intermediate-level
        source fanatic will be able to pick apart these maps and find a number of issues with them.
        please excuse my ignorance.</p>
      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe textures were made in many different ways. some were ai-generated.
        some painted by hand. 
        some generated via software. 
        eh, maybe some ripped ones too. same goes for the models, fuck knows where they came from. i ripped them
        directly from other maps. LOL!
      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspshoutout to you if your textures/models ended up in my map, they were stolen with
        good intentions ❤️ i hope you enjoy these maps, feel free to pick them apart and openly cricicize my ameteur mapmaking
        skills.
