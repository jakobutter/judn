<div style="text-align: left; font-size:24px; margin:20px">
      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspto see my family grow old, the ones that are now far, far away. a quiet life in the little dutch town of rozenberg. just about all you need in life. happy, accepting loved ones. portugese wine. strawberry tea and the world's finest cheese. maybe some smoke from across the water. it won't be long now. i don't have dates.
    </p><p>
           &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspi don't want a lot, really. just 4-5 years in the spotlight. enough to live on. if i have kids some day, enough to give them what i almost had. nothing too flashy, a few nice leather coats and boots. i don't dress too much. part of me wants to be different but that would be the same. i already feel like i know what's good for me and what's not.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspi'm cold. and tired. in a beautiful unfamiliar place. i have a lot to do.
