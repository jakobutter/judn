<br><br>
i grew into luscious unkept hair<br>i admit i'm not smart all the time<br>but when i kiss bae those frights<br> werent there<br>with your sunkissed face and your dark brown stare<br><br>
though i know i wasnt always there<br>nevermind what i'd say, i still care<br>seen you went that way, was it all right-faired?<br>or the my old way saying life's not fair?<br><br>whether fame hits that way i'll get back<br>i'm not working on it all the time<br>saw a t4t ttt map <br>and said why don't i make one like that? <br>though you got someone to hold you<br> there<br>i seek these secrets so hard to share<br>everytime i make source maps i wear<br>FUCK YOU FUCK t shirt, converse, same pair<br><br>
and your shit fell out of my coat pocket<br>i almost thought that i lost it<br>dont even care how long its been<br>these things get me reminiscing<br><br>and no matter if you're never listening<br>i adore knowing you're existing<br>i'd get frisky, no one fixed me<br>i might need some new views this spring<br>

<a  >Apple Scruffs by George Harrison</a>
<p>
You've been stood around for years<br>
Seen my smiles and touched my tears<br>
How it's been a long, long time<br>
And how you've been on my mind, my Apple Scruffs

<p>although my heart still holds partitions</p>

                <a>Yvonne by Paul McCartney</a>
<p>When I first saw Yvonne, volcanoes erupted</p>
<p>And laughter flowed into my life</p>
<p>She seemed all right, nothing wrong</p>
<p>Everything about her was so strong</p>
<p>But I know no one’s gonna keep us apart</p><br>
<p>Yvonne’s the one I’ve been counting on</p>
<p>She said, "hold on, you’re not the only one"</p>
<p>And so I said so long Yvonne</p>
